# AI Radiologist

AI Radiologist is an intelligent system that automatically generates medical radiology reports from X-ray images using deep learning techniques.

The model combines ResNet-50 for image feature extraction and T5 Transformer for natural language report generation.

## Technologies Used
- **Back-End:** Python, Django, Django REST Framework
- **Front-End:** React.js
- **AI Models:** ResNet-50, T5 Transformer
- **Authentication:** Google OAuth 2.0

## Features
- Upload and analyze X-ray images
- Generate detailed radiology reports automatically
- Secure user authentication
- Interactive and user-friendly interface

This project aims to support radiologists and medical centers by providing fast and accurate preliminary reports, helping to improve diagnostic workflows.
